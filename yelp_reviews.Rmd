## Load businesses
First, let's load the Yelp businesses. I used the JSON to CSV converter in https://github.com/Yelp/dataset-examples to make it easier for me to load.

```{r load data}
reviews = read_csv("data/yelp_academic_dataset_review.csv")
businesses = read_csv("data/yelp_academic_dataset_business.csv")
```

## Get Mexican restaurants
Get Mexican restaurants with the most reviews
```{r}
reviews %>% filter(categories )
```


## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
